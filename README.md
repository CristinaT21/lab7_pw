# **Lab 7**

I created a CRUD API for the entities in the [previous laboratory work](https://github.com/CristinaT21/lab6-pw).

### The routes 
are only accessible with a JWT
 - login
 - get all color palettes
 - add new color palette
 - update a specific color palette
 - get a specific color palette
 - delete a specific color palette

 -----
### The roles
- user
- admin

---

API has documentation using Swagger UI.

I added pagination support.
